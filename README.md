1.Terminal Typing Master:

Objective: To develop a terminal-based typing test application. The application tests the user's typing speed by presenting a list of random words from a selected category and measures metrics like words per minute (WPM).

2.Terminal-Based Maze Solver:

Objective: To develop a terminal-based application that generates a random maze, finds a path from the start to the end, and visualizes the maze and path in the terminal.

3.Autocorrection Feature:

Objective: The primary objective is to develop a terminal-based application that suggests correct   spellings for input words. It involves the use of trie for efficient word storage and retrieval, and the Damerau- Levenshtein distance algorithm for calculating the closest spelling suggestions. The application will also allow users to manage the underlying dictionary.
